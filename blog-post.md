# Building Code Researcher: From Research Paper to Production with Amazon Q Developer CLI and AWS Strands Agents

*How I used Amazon Q Developer CLI with Claude 4 Sonnet to understand a complex research paper and implement a sophisticated AI agent system for automated software debugging*

## Introduction

Recently, I came across a fascinating research paper about "Code Researcher" - an AI system that can automatically analyze and fix complex software crashes, particularly in the Linux kernel. The paper described a sophisticated two-phase approach using deep code exploration and historical commit analysis to achieve state-of-the-art results on kernel crash resolution.

As a developer interested in AI agents and automated debugging, I was intrigued by the potential of implementing this system using modern tools. That's when I decided to leverage **Amazon Q Developer CLI** with the new **Claude 4 Sonnet** model to help me understand the research and implement it using **AWS Strands Agents** - Amazon's open-source AI agents SDK.

In this blog post, I'll walk you through my journey of using AI to understand AI research and build a production-ready implementation.

## The Challenge: Understanding Complex Research

The Code Researcher paper was dense - 30 pages of technical details about:
- Multi-phase agent architectures
- Git repository analysis techniques  
- Symbol definition searching with ctags
- Historical commit pattern matching
- Crash reproduction systems
- Performance benchmarks on 279 Linux kernel crashes

Rather than spending days manually parsing through this complexity, I decided to use Amazon Q Developer CLI as my research assistant.

## Step 1: AI-Powered Research Analysis

I started by uploading the research paper PDF to my workspace and asking Amazon Q Developer CLI to analyze it:

```bash
q chat
```

Then I asked:
> "What do you understand in the PDF file in the directory?"

Amazon Q Developer CLI, powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, immediately:

1. **Extracted and parsed the PDF content** using Python libraries
2. **Identified the core architecture** - a two-phase system with Analysis and Synthesis phases
3. **Explained the key innovations** - deep exploration using git history and ctags
4. **Summarized the performance results** - 30.9% crash resolution rate on challenging benchmarks
5. **Highlighted the technical approach** - systematic context gathering before patch generation

The AI provided a comprehensive breakdown that would have taken me hours to compile manually.

## Step 2: Exploring Implementation Options

Next, I asked Q Developer CLI about implementation approaches:

> "I want to implement the same using the AWS Strands agent library. Give me a technical implementation outline"

The AI immediately provided a detailed technical architecture, including:
- Multi-agent system design with orchestrator pattern
- AWS Lambda functions for code analysis tools
- DynamoDB for context storage
- Integration patterns with AWS services

But I wanted to use the specific Strands SDK, so I clarified:

> "I want to use Strands agents library not bedrock agents"

## Step 3: Learning from Examples

I had the Strands SDK examples in my workspace, so I asked Q Developer CLI to examine them:

> "Look into the folder containing strands sdk examples, then create a technical implementation plan"

The AI analyzed the Strands examples and discovered key patterns:
- **Agent-as-Tools architecture** for hierarchical agent systems
- **Custom tool creation** using `@tool` decorators
- **BedrockModel integration** with Claude 4 Sonnet
- **Streaming responses** for real-time interaction
- **Extended thinking capabilities** for complex reasoning

## Step 4: Architecture Design

Based on the research paper and Strands examples, Q Developer CLI helped me design a sophisticated multi-agent architecture:

### Orchestrator Agent
The main coordinator that manages the overall workflow:

```python
from strands import Agent, tool
from strands.models import BedrockModel

class CodeResearcherOrchestrator(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = BedrockModel(
            model_id="anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0",
            additional_request_fields={
                "thinking": {
                    "type": "enabled",
                    "budget_tokens": 4096,
                }
            }
        )
        
        super().__init__(
            model=self.model,
            system_prompt=self._get_orchestrator_prompt(),
            tools=[
                self._create_analysis_agent_tool(),
                self._create_synthesis_agent_tool()
            ]
        )
```

### Analysis Agent (Deep Research Specialist)
Focused on code exploration and context gathering:

```python
class CodeAnalysisAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            model=BedrockModel(
                model_id="anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0",
                temperature=0.1  # Lower temperature for precise analysis
            ),
            system_prompt=self._get_analysis_prompt(),
            tools=[
                SearchDefinitionTool(),
                SearchCodeTool(), 
                SearchCommitsTool()
            ]
        )
```

### Synthesis Agent (Patch Generation Specialist)
Specialized in creating fixes based on analysis:

```python
class CodeSynthesisAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            model=BedrockModel(
                model_id="anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0",
                temperature=0.3  # Higher temperature for creative solutions
            ),
            system_prompt=self._get_synthesis_prompt(),
            tools=[
                GeneratePatchTool(),
                ValidatePatchTool()
            ]
        )
```

## Step 5: Implementing Agent-as-Tools Pattern

One of the most elegant aspects of the Strands SDK is the Agent-as-Tools pattern. Q Developer CLI helped me understand how to wrap specialized agents as tools:

```python
@tool
def analysis_agent(crash_report: str, repository_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Perform deep analysis of a crash report using specialized analysis agent.
    """
    analysis_agent = CodeAnalysisAgent()
    
    analysis_prompt = f"""
    Analyze this crash report and gather comprehensive context:
    
    CRASH REPORT:
    {crash_report}
    
    Perform systematic analysis using your available tools.
    """
    
    result = analysis_agent(analysis_prompt)
    return json.dumps(extract_analysis_context(result))

@tool  
def synthesis_agent(analysis_context: str) -> str:
    """
    Generate patches based on analysis context.
    """
    synthesis_agent = CodeSynthesisAgent()
    
    synthesis_prompt = f"""
    Based on this analysis, generate a fix:
    
    CONTEXT: {analysis_context}
    
    Provide hypothesis and patches.
    """
    
    result = synthesis_agent(synthesis_prompt)
    return json.dumps(extract_patches(result))
```

## Step 6: Building the Tool Infrastructure

The research paper emphasized the importance of sophisticated code analysis tools. Q Developer CLI helped me design AWS Lambda functions that implement the core research capabilities:

### Symbol Definition Search (ctags integration)
```python
@tool
def search_definition(symbol_name: str, file_path: str = None) -> str:
    """Search for symbol definitions using ctags."""
    lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
    
    payload = {
        'action': 'search_definition',
        'symbol_name': symbol_name,
        'file_path': file_path
    }
    
    response = lambda_client.invoke(
        FunctionName='code-analysis-function',
        Payload=json.dumps(payload)
    )
    
    return json.loads(response['Payload'].read())
```

### Git History Analysis
```python
@tool
def search_commits(query: str, search_type: str = "both") -> str:
    """Search git commit history for relevant changes."""
    # Implementation that searches both commit messages and code changes
    # Returns historical fixes for similar issues
```

## Step 7: Integration with Amazon Q Developer CLI

The final piece was integrating the system with Q Developer CLI for seamless usage:

```python
# CLI integration
@click.command()
@click.option('--crash-report', required=True)
@click.option('--repository', required=True)
def analyze_crash(crash_report, repository):
    """Analyze and fix software crashes using Code Researcher."""
    
    with open(crash_report, 'r') as f:
        crash_content = f.read()
    
    system = CodeResearcherSystem()
    result = asyncio.run(system.analyze_crash(crash_content, repository))
    
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```
